"""Flask REST API for the vm_manager backends.

Routes are thin wrappers around the public ``vm_manager`` functions.

This application authenticates nobody and has no CSRF token flow. In
production it is imported by the wsgi.py of the vmmgrapi Ansible role,
served by gunicorn on a unix socket, and only reachable through an nginx
that terminates TLS and enforces the basic auth and the ACL. It must
never be published directly.

The public API (``GET /stop/<guest>``, ``GET /start/<guest>``) must not
change, so the state-changing routes stay on GET. A browser can issue a
cross-site GET or form POST without any preflight, and may attach cached
basic auth credentials, so a before_request hook rejects cross-site
requests to those routes, using the Fetch-Metadata ``Sec-Fetch-Site``
header and the ``Origin`` header. Clients that send neither (curl,
scripts) are not browsers and are allowed through.
